            Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I'm Yen. I have experience as
            an international sales professional for 1 year and as a logistic
            assistant for 5 years. Inspired by the transformative potential of
            technology, I aspire to create something impactful and innovative.
            Embracing the philosophy of seizing opportunities, I made the bold
            decision to transition into web development and began my studies in
            Canada in 2023. Learning coding and problem-solving has been an
            enjoyable journey for me!
